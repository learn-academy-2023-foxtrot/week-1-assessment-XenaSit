# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: To my limited knowledge of research 7 days ago i say that GIT is like a cloude that stores all documents that people want to save. And GitHub is one of the sites that lets you look, alter and share your document. While i am here i do have a quiation: is the GitLab also like GitHub? I am still not sure, eventhough it looks similar only with a fof logo (which i realy like).

Researched answer: well... poop... it is exactly the other way around. Git is actualy a "version control system" (had to plagarize here) that lets you keep track of your code and GITHUB is the cloud storage for that code. 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: JS operator? Whats that??? as one might ask... not me. I completly understand that the JS operator is a code or a method that requsts something fancy and returns a simple answer like boolean. Which operator will return boolean value, thats another quastion. All the equals signs, and greater or less than, and % (this simply should be called presentage, oh no, but not in JS. this thing is some medulo or mudolo anyway, the point is it gives the remainder after devision), multiplication, devision... algebra 101 "insert here". 
    Shortly: we use any type of equasion possobility to test if our code brings true or false and than with if-else we loop through them with joy until it becomes the true value we are looking for. And this is when magicly the true code apears out of nowhere. and let us know that the code we wrote is not a complete waste.

Researched answer: Noooooooo! i am crying inside. There are only 3 oprators that test true/false (|| OR) (&& AND) (! NOT). 
10 hrs later
Ohhhhhh! it compares to return boolean. But what is up with ===, ==, <=, >=   ???

3. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: OH yes! something i know. INDEX is the location of a particular thing that is in array aka. value. VALUE is a particular thing that is stored in the array. 

Researched answer: Well, i am not wrong, but i cant seem to find a defenition. All searches tell me to use a loop to find out if i have a value in my array. 

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: oooh! 
COMPARE: They both hold values, have indexes of those values and can be manipulated.
CONTRAST: Other than that there is nothing similar about arrays and strings. While an array is the greatest manipulatable data held within a small space, string is difficult and is simple to the point that you have to turn it into an array to manipulate it. Yes, i said it. 

Researched answer: apparently an ARRAY is a data structure that hold collection of elements, while the string holds collection of charactors. 

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Driver and Navigator. (I can tell i am getting tired. The sarcasm is dying down.) driver types and is not allowed to think and type at the same time. Navigator is thinking and is not allowed to type and think at the same time. 

Researched answer: Oh how wrong am i. Apparently the Driver types the code, explaines outloud what they are doing, Thinking and overthinking and takes advice from the navigator if needed. NAVIGATOR points out if the comma was misplaced, and helps the driver if they are stuck. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: it is a function that takes in several functions into its function or returns a function as a result. 

2. Jest: a simple testing technique for JS. Some call it a "Delightfull Javascript Testing" (which i might add has nothing delightfull about it. it takes longer to write than to do it by hand, unless it is a secret tool to make me practice my spelling).

3. Objects: JS datatype to store whole bunch of information.
